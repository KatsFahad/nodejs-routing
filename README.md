# Simple routing in Node.Js
(No Express.Js Used)

Using node.Js to create a simple server that listens to requests on a certain port locally.
The responses are files of different pages.
The user can go to different pages on the server but if the user requests for a page outside the scope they get a page saying PAGE doesnt exists.
